# WebDesign
Responsive website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

To view properly, download the HTML, CSS, JS, and image files to the same folder. Launch an HTML file in a browser, and treat it like a normal website. 

This website was made for a web design class.

The site was made with a "small-screen first" approach. As screen size increases, the site expands with it. This eliminates the problem of rearranging a site made to first look good on a larger screen.

The stylings at different sizes are handled by CSS breakpoints.

Most of the design is percentage and em-based to achieve an attractive and functional design as the window resizes. 
This, along with the break points, accommodate virtually any display and any screen size or situation.
